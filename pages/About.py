    st.write("I was a walk-on cross country and track runner at George Mason University (Fairfax, VA). Many of my teammates were spectacular, but numerous teammates experienced overuse injuries. Over-use injuries, such as stress fractures, were difficult to predict ahead of time, especially at the elite level. I feared developing an over-use injury. As a result, I under-trained and struggled to find breakthrough. Out of frutstration, I left NCAA competition and joined the Potomac River Running Elite Racing team in DC-VA where I began to run personal bests in the 5k (16:09), 10k (33:25), 10-mile (55:33) and half-marathon (1:15:40). I was able to learn how to properly push myself to new limits. I also ran a 2:50 marathon (Traverse City, MI) in 2018 to qualify for the Boston Marathon. I am now a PhD candidate studying the intersection of biomechanics, wearables, and AI to deliver personalized-insights into training to push athletes to achieve their potential.")
